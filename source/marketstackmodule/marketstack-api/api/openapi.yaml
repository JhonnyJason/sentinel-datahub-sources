  title: Marketstack API v2
  description: |
    The official Marketstack API documentation will help you learn how to query the Marketstack JSON API for real-time, intraday, and historical stock market data, along with more advanced EDGAR data endpoints. Also, define multiple stock symbols, retrieve extensive data about 2700+ Stock Exchanges Info, 30000+ Stock tickers from more than 50 countries, as well as 750 + Stock Market indexes, information about timezones, currencies, and more.

    Our API is built upon a RESTful and easy-to-understand request and response structure. API requests are always sent using a simple API request URL with a series of required and optional HTTPS GET parameters, and API responses are provided in lightweight JSON format.

      description: |-
        You can use the API's `eod` endpoint in order to obtain end-of-day data for one or multiple stock tickers. A single or multiple comma-separated ticker symbols are passed to the API using the `symbols` parameter.


        **Note:**

        * *The EOD data has access to over 500,000 tickers from more major world-known exchanges. The full list of supported tickers and exchanges can be seen here:* [**Download**](https://marketstack.com/download/v2_eod_tickers_finnworlds_tiingo.xlsx)

        * *A daily updated list of all tickers accessible via Marketstack is available for download:* [**Download Ticker List**](https://marketstack.com/download/supported_tickers_2.csv)

        * *The V2 EOD endpoint supports data from **30+ stock exchanges**, including **NASDAQ,** **PINK, SHG, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTCQB,** and **BATS***

        * *To retrieve end-of-day data for individual tickers, you can also use the Tickers Endpoint.*

        * ***Ticker Symbol Formatting:** When querying ticker symbols that include a period (.), replace the period with a hyphen (-) in the intraday endpoint. **Example:BRK.B → BRK-B***

        **Adjusted Prices:**
        “**Adjusted**” prices represent stock values that have been modified to accurately reflect the impact of corporate actions such as splits and dividends. These adjustments are applied following the CRSP Calculations methodology established by the **Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).**

      description: |-
        In additional to daily end-of-day stock prices, the Marketstack API also supports intraday data with data intervals as short as one minute. Intraday prices are available for all US stock tickers included in the IEX (Investors Exchange) stock exchange.

        To access intraday market data, use the API’s Intraday Endpoint and specify your desired stock ticker symbols.

        **Notes:**

        * *A daily updated list of all tickers accessible via Marketstack is available for download:[**Download Ticker List**](https://marketstack.com/download/supported_tickers_2.csv)*

        * *You can also request intraday data for **individual ticker symbols** using the **Tickers Endpoint.***

        * ***Ticker Symbol Formatting:** When querying ticker symbols that include a period (.), replace the period with a hyphen (-) when using the Intraday Endpoint. **Example:** BRK.B → BRK-B*

        **IMPORTANT NOTE:** In the case of Intraday, Marketstack provides derived data that calculates a real-time reference price for each asset. While this is not a substitute for the TOPS Feed, we believe it will fulfill the needs of 95% of our customer base.

        We’re doing so because as of **February 1st, 2025**, the IEX Exchange has changed its market data policies. To receive the FULL TOPS Feed, you must now have a market data agreement signed with the IEX Exchange. This means that the parameters bidPrice, bidSize, askPrice, askSize, lastPrice, lastSize, mid, and last will all return NULL in the API response for intraday since **IEX entitlement is required** for them. If you still need to have access to TOPS Feed, please contact our customer support team before signing any contract with them.

        For using our derived data, there is no need to have a market data agreement signed with the IEX exchange, and there is no additional cost to the IEX Exchange.`

        If you are looking for past commodity prices, you can use the Historical Commodity Prices endpoint, where you can choose specific dates and search by individual commodities. Additionally, the API offers options for daily data from the previous five years or monthly intervals using the `frequency` parameter.

        **Note:**

        * A rate limit of 1 API call per minute is enforced on this endpoint.

        * The recommended historical date range for a single API call is 1 year when requesting daily data. While larger ranges (up to 1.5 years) may work, retrieving data one year at a time ensures consistency.

        * Historical data for Commodities is available for up to 15 years in the past, though coverage varies by commodity type like **Metals:** Typically over 13 years of historical data, with some having as few as 2 years. **Energy:** Generally 15 years of coverage, though a few have up to 10 years. **Industrial:** Usually 15 years, with some limited to 10 years. **Livestock and Agricultural:** Coverage ranges from 9 to 15 years.

      description: "The frames API aggregates one fact for each reporting entity that\
        \ is the last filed that most closely fits the calendrical period requested.\
        \ This API supports annual, quarterly, and instantaneous data. This API endpoint\
        \ is made for the US-GAAP taxonomy and the Accounts Payable Current type of\
        \ the taxonomy.           \nWhere the units of measure specified in the API\
        \ contain a numerator and a denominator, these are separated by “-per-” such\
        \ as “USD-per-shares”. Note that the default unit in XBRL is “pure”.     \
        \      \nThe period format is CY#### for annual data (duration 365 days +/-\
        \ 30 days), CY####Q# for quarterly data (duration 91 days +/- 30 days), and\
        \ CY####Q#I for instantaneous data. Because company financial calendars can\
        \ start and end on any month or day and even change in length from quarter\
        \ to quarter according to the day of the week, the frame data is assembled\
        \ by the dates that best align with a calendar quarter or year. Data users\
        \ should be mindful of the different reporting start and end dates for facts\
